Background
A Superstore operates across multiple regions, selling a diverse range of products including furniture, office supplies, and technology. The store aims to enhance its decision-making process by utilizing data-driven insights to monitor sales performance, manage inventory, and understand customer behavior. Currently, the data is scattered across various sources, making it challenging to get a comprehensive view of the business operations.

Objectives
The primary objective is to develop an interactive sales dashboard for the Superstore that consolidates data from various sources into a single, easy-to-use platform. This dashboard will provide real-time insights into sales metrics, inventory levels, customer demographics, and the effectiveness of promotions. By leveraging this dashboard, the store management can make informed decisions to optimize operations, improve sales, and increase profitability.
